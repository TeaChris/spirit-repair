      body: 'SOA is a project that is here to be more of a solution, it is here to help make things easier for us, it requires that we believe in ourselves once again and acknowledge that working together in this new future will be easier. With this project we hope to build a community that makes it easier to onboard people first into the NFT space and by extension the Metaverse. SOA community is aimed to be a self supporting ecosystem for Africans with unique skills/talent and also those who seek to learn these skills. This project is unique as it is the collective of the African spirits, regardless of country, tribe or creed, as long as we are Africans. A major goal of the project is developing the African youth and helping them attain full potential, hereby giving them the chance to live a much better and easier life.',

Three of the five are creative graphic artists and the other two are talented young men who fell in love with the SOA project idea and are willing to give 200% to its success. Weâ€™ve made significant progress so far and we will continue to forge ahead.',

So from "Our humble beginning" we will get to "Walk with the Spirits", follow "As the Spirits leads" us, we will meet a Spirit that will introduce itself as "A god", we will also discover "A new Spirit" by the way and at this stage I think we should be "Dining with the Spirits" cause we've seen too many now. And as we dine with them, we become "One with the Spirits" and as we are one with the Spirits, "The Spirits will abide with us" and the we journey down "Into the Spirit Land" where we will call our home and grow. You can read more about the roadmap at #ðŸ›£â”‚roadmap`,
